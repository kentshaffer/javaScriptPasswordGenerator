# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

HTML and CSS starter code was given for the page styling of this assignment, but the password generating JavaScript was still needed to make the user inputs on the page operational. 

## Areas addressed:

* Individual variables created containing arrays of all possible uppercase, lower case, numeric, and special characters.
* Window prompt added with parameters for password length input.
* If statements added with window confirms to include or exclude character types.
* For loop added to randomize selections from selected character arrays and output a generated password of the requested length.
* Return results from the array selection joined so the password output is dislayed as a single string rather than individual array items.
